  Abstract                 = {The role of growth twin boundaries on the slip activity of gold nanopillars under uniaxial compression was investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. A new type of size-dependent strengthening was found in twinned gold nanopillars. Strengthening resulted from slip arrests in the form of Lomer?Cottrell locks at the intersection of partial dislocations and twin boundaries. The significance of such phenomenon was found to depend on the twin size. These findings could help engineers design tunable mechanical properties in nanowires by interfacial plasticity.},

Profuse twinning activities in Ag supply partial dislocations to directly transmit across the Ag-Cu lamellar interface that promotes deformation twinning in the neighbouring Cu lamellae although the interface is severely deformed. The trans-interface twin bands change the local structure at the interface. Our analysis suggests that the orientation relationship and interfacial structure between neighbouring Ag-Cu lamellae play a crucial role in such special interface-facilitated twinning behaviour.},

The fcc crystal with a {100} free surface containing a monatomic step lying along a (110) dense direction is submitted to an increasing uniaxial stress along a direction belonging to the {100} plane. For a sufficiently high applied stress, well below the theoretical strength. dislocations are nucleated at the step and glide in the {111} planes emerging at the step. The effect of a stress orientation is examined. The type of dislocation formed. that is Shockley partials of 90° and 30° character or perfect dislocations, is rationalized by considering the resolved shear stress in the {111} planes. The plane where glide will occur is favoured well before nucleation; a shear of increasing amplitude and extension is progressively localized on this plane. The role of the stress field due to the step, in the formation of the localized shear, is discussed. },

It is shown that for the pseudo-equilibrium of a number of individual crystals surface energy effects could produce transformation over a temperature range but the other effects of the transformation are not explained. Quantitative results for the number of hexagonal faults show that these cannot be in thermal equilibrium. The transformation in cobalt is martensitic in nature and the mechanism is considered in terms of {\textquoteright}half dislocations{\textquoteright} of the face-centred-cubic (f.c.c.) lattice. It is shown qualitatively that in the case of these dislocations reflexion at a free surface can lead to the production of a twinned structure or, under favourable conditions, to the transformation from f.c.c. to close-packed-hexagonal (c.p.h.). The faults in hexagonal cobalt can be considered to be the result of {\textquoteright}wrong{\textquoteright} reflexions during the transformation. The characteristic features of martensitic transformations can be explained in terms of the dislocation mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The interface-mediated plastic deformation mechanisms of a semi-coherent Cu?Ag bimetal nanolayered structure subjected to out-of-plane tension are characterized by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that the initially planar Cu?Ag nanolayers abruptly become wavy at a critical tensile strain. This planar-to-wavy interlayer transition is facilitated by the low shear resistance of the Cu?Ag interlayer interface, which slides to accommodate the out-of-plane deformation. The process redistributes misfit dislocations along the interface to reduce the bending energy of the wavy structure. High stress concentrations subsequently develop at the summits and valleys of the wavy Cu?Ag interlayer interfaces, from which micro-twinning partials are emitted. These results demonstrate that the wavelength of the wavy Cu?Ag nanolayer structure forms a critical length scale for the localization of spatially periodic defect sources for twin nucleation. This planar-to-wavy interlayer transition mechanism is only activated in nanolayered metals with interfaces that are amenable to sliding prior to twin or dislocation emissions.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract The structure of asymmetric [110] tilt boundaries developed during creep of pure aluminium single crystals is studied using high-resolution electron microscopy. The small- and moderate-misorientation boundaries are composed of Lomer and 60° dislocations. Extensive image simulation is used to deduce the detailed core structures of these two dislocations. Comparisons with calculated elastic displacements indicate that the Lomer dislocation is not detectably dissociated in its (001) glide plane, or into the sessile Lomer-Cottrell configuration. The agreement between the observed atomic column positions and continuum elasticity is excellent, except for the innermost positions near the core of the Lomer dislocation. The core structure of these discrete Lomer dislocations also correlates well with previous atomistic calculations for a larger-misorientation ? = 19 boundary. A similar analysis of the displacements around 60° dislocations using isotropic elasticity indicates a slight dissociation of about 0.55 ± 0.15nm on the {111}. The lateral migration of boundaries in the thin transmission electron microscopy foils is also observed to occur by the motion of 60° dislocations within the boundary plane via a reversible Lomer reaction. The observation of an alternate core structure for the Lomer dislocation during this migration process is explained by the presence of a kink along the dislocation line. Multislice image simulations in which the structure varies with depth are used to study the effects of kinks and dislocation inclination on core structure images in thin foils. The implications of these observations in terms of dislocation glide on (001) in aluminium, are discussed. },

The potential accurately reproduces the lattice parameter, cohesive energy, elastic constants, phonon frequencies, thermal expansion, lattice-defect energies, as well as energies of alternate structures of Ag. Combining this potential with an existing EAM potential for Cu, a binary potential set for the Cu?Ag system has been constructed by fitting the cross-interaction function to first-principles energies of imaginary Cu?Ag compounds. Although properties used in the fit refer to the 0?K temperature (except for thermal expansion factors of pure Cu and Ag) and do not include liquid configurations, the potentials demonstrate good transferability to high-temperature properties. In particular, the entire Cu?Ag phase diagram calculated with the new potentials in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations is in satisfactory agreement with experiment. This agreement suggests that EAM potentials accurately fit to 0?K properties can be capable of correctly predicting simple phase diagrams. Possible applications of the new potential set are outlined.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrafine polycrystalline metals containing nanotwins exhibit simultaneous ultrahigh strength and ductility. We study the plastic deformation of such materials through molecular dynamics simulations. Based upon these simulations, we trace the sequence of dislocation events associated with the initiation of plastic deformation, dislocation interaction with twin boundaries, dislocation multiplication and deformation debris formation. We report two new dislocation mechanisms that explain the observation of both ultrahigh strength and ductility found in this class of microstructures. First, we observe the interaction of a 60° dislocation with a twin boundary that leads to the formation of a { 0 0 1 } ? 1 1 0 ? Lomer dislocation which, in turn, dissociates into Shockley, stair-rod and Frank partial dislocations. Second, the interaction of a 30° Shockley partial dislocation with a twin boundary generates three new Shockley partials during twin-mediated slip transfer. The generation of a high-density of Shockley partial dislocations on several different slip systems contributes to the observed ultrahigh ductility, while the formation of sessile stair-rod and Frank partial dislocations (together with the presence of the twin boundaries themselves) explain observations of ultrahigh strength. Our simulation highlights the importance of interplay between the carriers of and barriers to plastic deformation in achieving simultaneous ultrahigh strength and ductility.},

In fact, the strength of materials may be within a factor of two to three of the theoretical strength limit. The dependence of strength on the bilayer period for these multilayers synthesized by vapor deposition techniques is reviewed. It is shown that deformation mechanisms that operate in micron-scale may not be applicable at the nanometer length scales. Dislocation-based models are developed to predict the transition from bulk-like deformation mechanisms to nano-scale deformation mechanisms, and the results presented in adeformation mechanism mapso. Factors that maximize the rate of hardening with decreasing bilayer period and the maximum strength achieved are discussed.},

For this face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic system with incoherent interfaces, we develop dislocation models for the multilayer flow strength as a function of length scale from greater than a micrometer to less than a nanometer. A dislocation pile-up-based Hall?Petch model is found applicable at the sub-micrometer length scales and the Hall?Petch slope is used to estimate the peak strength of the multilayers. At the few to a few tens of nanometers length scales, confined layer slip of single dislocations is treated as the operative mechanism. The effects of dislocation core spreading along the interface, interface stress and interface dislocation arrays on the confined layer slip stress are incorporated in the model to correctly predict the strength increase with decreasing layer thickness. At layer thicknesses of a few nanometers or less, the strength reaches a peak. We postulate that this peak strength is set by the interface resistance to single dislocation transmission, and calculate the transition from confined layer slip to an interface cutting mechanism.},

  abstract      = {Abstract Strain localization is a common deformation-induced instability in many metallic metals. How it happens is related to both microstructure and the way in which plasticity is mediated prior to localization. Both aspects can fundamentally change in a face-centered cubic metal when it becomes nanostructured; the propensity for deformation twinning increases and the behavior is dominated by dislocation?interface interactions. Here we carry out a transmission electron microscopy investigation to elucidate the collaborative role of deformation twinning and dislocation transmission on the onset of strain localization in nanolayered composites. Two material systems are examined, Cu?Ag and Cu?Nb, and for each system, two interface structures are examined, one prone to dislocation transmission and the other not. We show that dislocation transmission favors crystallographic band formation, whereas dislocations that do not transmit cause interface tilting and are associated with (non-crystallographic) shear band formation.},

We investigated the maximum strength of nanotwinned copper samples with different twin thicknesses. We found that the strength increases with decreasing twin thickness, reaching a maximum at 15 nanometers, followed by a softening at smaller values that is accompanied by enhanced strain hardening and tensile ductility. The strongest twin thickness originates from a transition in the yielding mechanism from the slip transfer across twin boundaries to the activity of preexisting easy dislocation sources.},

  abstract       = {The strengthening effect of twins in nanocrystalline metals has been reported both in experiment and simulation. While twins are mostly considered as effective barriers to dislocation slip transfer, they can also provide nucleation sites for dislocations or migrate during the deformation process, thereby contributing to plasticity. By comparing twinned and nontwinned samples, we study the effect of twins on the deformation behavior of nanocrystalline Cu and Pd using atomistic simulations. While Cu shows hardening due to the presence of twins, Pd shows the opposite effect. A quantitative dislocation analysis method is applied, which allows to analyze dislocation interactions with twin planes and grain boundaries and to measure dislocation, stacking fault, and twin-boundary densities as functions of strain. A statistical analysis of the occurring dislo- cation types provides direct evidence for the role of twin boundaries as effective sources for twinning dislo- cations, which are the reason for the observed softening in some fcc materials. In addition, we discuss how the orientation of the loading direction with respect to the twin planes affects the response of nanotwinned Cu and Pd.},

Here, we report a dislocation-based mechanism of SFT formation initiated from the semi-coherent interfaces of Cu?Al nanoscale multilayered metals subjected to out-of-plane tension. Our molecular dynamics simulations show that Shockley partials are first emitted into the Cu interlayers from the dissociated misfit dislocations along the Cu?Al interface and interact to form SFTs above the triangular intrinsic stacking faults along the interface. Under further deformation, Shockley partials are also emitted into the Al interlayers and interact to form SFTs above the triangular FCC planes along the interface. The resulting dislocation structure comprises closed SFTs within the Cu interlayers which are tied across the Cu?Al interfaces to open-ended SFTs within the Al interlayers. This unique plastic deformation mechanism results in considerable strain hardening of the Cu?Al nanolayered metal, which achieves its highest tensile strength at a critical interlayer thickness of ~4 nm corresponding to the highest possible density of complete SFTs within the nanolayer structure.},

The presence of these twins is directly related to the nanocrystalline structure, because they are not observed in coarse-grained pure aluminum. We propose a dislocation-based model to explain the preference for deformation twins and stacking faults in nanocrystalline materials. These results underscore a transition from deformation mechanisms controlled by normal slip to those controlled by partial dislocation activity when grain size decreases to tens of nanometers, and they have implications for interpreting the unusual mechanical behavior of nanocrystalline materials.},

  abstract       = {Epitaxial Au thin films with thicknesses of 40?160 nm were grown on (1 0 0)-oriented single-crystal NaCl substrates at 300 °C by magnetron sputtering. Microstructural analyses revealed that all films possess orthogonal twin networks along the ?0 1 1? directions. The experimentally observed relationship of an increase in twin density with decreasing film thickness is explained by kinematical and thermodynamical modeling. The developed twin model predicts a nanometer-sized width of the twins, in agreement with the experiment.},

  abstract      = {By using molecular dynamics simulations, we show that significant strain hardening and ultrahigh flow stresses are enabled in gold nanowires containing coherent (111) growth twins when balancing nanowire diameter and twin boundary spacing at the nanoscale. A fundamental transition in mechanical behavior occurs when the ratio of diameter to twin boundary spacing is larger than 2.14. A model based on site-specific dislocation nucleation and cross-slip mechanisms is proposed to explain the size dependence of flow behavior in twinned nanowires under tensile loading.},

  abstract  = {Abstract Under very high stresses, dislocations can be accelerated to approach the speed of shear wave over a distance as short as 101 nm. Our atomistic simulations demonstrate that dislocations with such high speeds often react in counter-intuitive manners that are beyond textbook descriptions of conventional dislocation behavior. A high-speed dislocation can “rebound” when hitting a free surface rather than simply annihilate. When two high-speed dislocations collide, they can “penetrate” through each other. An individual dislocation can even spontaneously generate multiple dislocations via self-dissociation. These anomalous mechanisms lead to rapid proliferation of dislocations that are strongly correlated both spatially and temporally, and as such may play a role in high-stress and high-strain-rate plastic deformation; a potentially related case is nanoscale pristine single crystals, which often yield via a large strain burst at ultrahigh stresses.},
