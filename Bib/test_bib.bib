  Abstract                 = {The role of growth twin boundaries on the slip activity of gold nanopillars under uniaxial compression was investigated by molecular dynamics simulation. A new type of size-dependent strengthening was found in twinned gold nanopillars. Strengthening resulted from slip arrests in the form of Lomer?Cottrell locks at the intersection of partial dislocations and twin boundaries. The significance of such phenomenon was found to depend on the twin size. These findings could help engineers design tunable mechanical properties in nanowires by interfacial plasticity.},

  Abstract                 = {We report an atomic-scale investigation of interface-facilitated deformation twinning behaviour in Ag-Cu nanolamellar composites. Profuse twinning activities in Ag supply partial dislocations to directly transmit across the Ag-Cu lamellar interface that promotes deformation twinning in the neighbouring Cu lamellae although the interface is severely deformed. The trans-interface twin bands change the local structure at the interface. Our analysis suggests that the orientation relationship and interfacial structure between neighbouring Ag-Cu lamellae play a crucial role in such special interface-facilitated twinning behaviour.},

The fcc crystal with a {100} free surface containing a monatomic step lying along a (110) dense direction is submitted to an increasing uniaxial stress along a direction belonging to the {100} plane. For a sufficiently high applied stress, well below the theoretical strength. dislocations are nucleated at the step and glide in the {111} planes emerging at the step. The effect of a stress orientation is examined. The type of dislocation formed. that is Shockley partials of 90° and 30° character or perfect dislocations, is rationalized by considering the resolved shear stress in the {111} planes. The plane where glide will occur is favoured well before nucleation; a shear of increasing amplitude and extension is progressively localized on this plane. The role of the stress field due to the step, in the formation of the localized shear, is discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {The suggestion that the faults in hexagonal cobalt are in thermal equilibrium with the structure and that the phase change in pure cobalt is influenced considerably by surface energy is examined. It is shown that for the pseudo-equilibrium of a number of individual crystals surface energy effects could produce transformation over a temperature range but the other effects of the transformation are not explained. Quantitative results for the number of hexagonal faults show that these cannot be in thermal equilibrium. The transformation in cobalt is martensitic in nature and the mechanism is considered in terms of {\textquoteright}half dislocations{\textquoteright} of the face-centred-cubic (f.c.c.) lattice. It is shown qualitatively that in the case of these dislocations reflexion at a free surface can lead to the production of a twinned structure or, under favourable conditions, to the transformation from f.c.c. to close-packed-hexagonal (c.p.h.). The faults in hexagonal cobalt can be considered to be the result of {\textquoteright}wrong{\textquoteright} reflexions during the transformation. The characteristic features of martensitic transformations can be explained in terms of the dislocation mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {The interface-mediated plastic deformation mechanisms of a semi-coherent Cu?Ag bimetal nanolayered structure subjected to out-of-plane tension are characterized by molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that the initially planar Cu?Ag nanolayers abruptly become wavy at a critical tensile strain. This planar-to-wavy interlayer transition is facilitated by the low shear resistance of the Cu?Ag interlayer interface, which slides to accommodate the out-of-plane deformation. The process redistributes misfit dislocations along the interface to reduce the bending energy of the wavy structure. High stress concentrations subsequently develop at the summits and valleys of the wavy Cu?Ag interlayer interfaces, from which micro-twinning partials are emitted. These results demonstrate that the wavelength of the wavy Cu?Ag nanolayer structure forms a critical length scale for the localization of spatially periodic defect sources for twin nucleation. This planar-to-wavy interlayer transition mechanism is only activated in nanolayered metals with interfaces that are amenable to sliding prior to twin or dislocation emissions.},

  Abstract                 = { Abstract The structure of asymmetric [110] tilt boundaries developed during creep of pure aluminium single crystals is studied using high-resolution electron microscopy. The small- and moderate-misorientation boundaries are composed of Lomer and 60° dislocations. Extensive image simulation is used to deduce the detailed core structures of these two dislocations. Comparisons with calculated elastic displacements indicate that the Lomer dislocation is not detectably dissociated in its (001) glide plane, or into the sessile Lomer-Cottrell configuration. The agreement between the observed atomic column positions and continuum elasticity is excellent, except for the innermost positions near the core of the Lomer dislocation. The core structure of these discrete Lomer dislocations also correlates well with previous atomistic calculations for a larger-misorientation ? = 19 boundary. A similar analysis of the displacements around 60° dislocations using isotropic elasticity indicates a slight dissociation of about 0.55 ± 0.15nm on the {111}. The lateral migration of boundaries in the thin transmission electron microscopy foils is also observed to occur by the motion of 60° dislocations within the boundary plane via a reversible Lomer reaction. The observation of an alternate core structure for the Lomer dislocation during this migration process is explained by the presence of a kink along the dislocation line. Multislice image simulations in which the structure varies with depth are used to study the effects of kinks and dislocation inclination on core structure images in thin foils. The implications of these observations in terms of dislocation glide on (001) in aluminium, are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {A new embedded-atom method (EAM) potential has been constructed for Ag by fitting to experimental and first-principles data. The potential accurately reproduces the lattice parameter, cohesive energy, elastic constants, phonon frequencies, thermal expansion, lattice-defect energies, as well as energies of alternate structures of Ag. Combining this potential with an existing EAM potential for Cu, a binary potential set for the Cu?Ag system has been constructed by fitting the cross-interaction function to first-principles energies of imaginary Cu?Ag compounds. Although properties used in the fit refer to the 0?K temperature (except for thermal expansion factors of pure Cu and Ag) and do not include liquid configurations, the potentials demonstrate good transferability to high-temperature properties. In particular, the entire Cu?Ag phase diagram calculated with the new potentials in conjunction with Monte Carlo simulations is in satisfactory agreement with experiment. This agreement suggests that EAM potentials accurately fit to 0?K properties can be capable of correctly predicting simple phase diagrams. Possible applications of the new potential set are outlined.},

  Abstract                 = {Ultrafine polycrystalline metals containing nanotwins exhibit simultaneous ultrahigh strength and ductility. We study the plastic deformation of such materials through molecular dynamics simulations. Based upon these simulations, we trace the sequence of dislocation events associated with the initiation of plastic deformation, dislocation interaction with twin boundaries, dislocation multiplication and deformation debris formation. We report two new dislocation mechanisms that explain the observation of both ultrahigh strength and ductility found in this class of microstructures. First, we observe the interaction of a 60° dislocation with a twin boundary that leads to the formation of a { 0 0 1 } ? 1 1 0 ? Lomer dislocation which, in turn, dissociates into Shockley, stair-rod and Frank partial dislocations. Second, the interaction of a 30° Shockley partial dislocation with a twin boundary generates three new Shockley partials during twin-mediated slip transfer. The generation of a high-density of Shockley partial dislocations on several different slip systems contributes to the observed ultrahigh ductility, while the formation of sessile stair-rod and Frank partial dislocations (together with the presence of the twin boundaries themselves) explain observations of ultrahigh strength. Our simulation highlights the importance of interplay between the carriers of and barriers to plastic deformation in achieving simultaneous ultrahigh strength and ductility.},
